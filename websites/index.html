    <h1>What is a Website</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>We will learn about websites and web technologies by examing various websites. The main one can be found at this web address: <a href="https://simplesite.joebloggsnz.repl.co/">simplesite</a>. Note that the web server that serves the site is not always running. An always up mirror site can be found at: <a href="https://asimplesite.netlify.app/">simplesite mirror</a>.</p>

    <h2>A simple explaination</h2>
    <p>If you search for how a website works using a search term like, 'how does a website work', you will get plenty
      of results. Some will be more useful than others depending on how 'technical' they are. However, following is a simple
      explaination.</p>
    <p>A website can be thought of as a collection of files housed in a folder on a web server. A web server is
      basically
      a specialised computer that runs web server software. The computer is purposely accessible on the Internet - so, by default the
      files that make up the website are as well. The location of the website folder (known as the website root) is associated
      with a Unique Resource Location or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL">URL</a> for short. No two websites can have the same root URL. The files in the website
      are arranged in folders just like files are on a typical home computer. For example, images are often stored in a
      folder called <b>images</b>. The files in the site have their own urls, the first part of which is the site root url, then the path to the file is added to the end of this. For example, if the site's url is <b>mycoolsite.co.nz</b> and there is an <b>images</b> folder that contains an image called <b>coolcat.jpg</b>, then the url of that image is <b>mycoolsite.co.nz/images/coolcat.jpg</b></p>
      <p>The files are typically of the following types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): These files have a html file extension and contain html syntax tags along
        with readable text. Click on this link to learn more: <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">what is html</a></li>
      <li>CSS (Cascading style sheets): These files have a css file extension and contain css syntax. Click on this link
        to learn more: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">what is css</a></li>
      <li>Images: These are normally jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and have the file extension jpeg or jpg.
        png (Portable Network Graphics) is the second most common image format. Other more efficient formats have been
        developed and are becoming more popular e.g. webp, and avif. Click on this link to learn more: <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML">images in
          HTML</a></li>
      <li>JavaScript: These files have a js file extension, and web browsers have built-in a JavaScript interpreters. They
        turn the text-like code into machine code that allows the web page's content to be dynamically altered. A web
        page or site that uses JavaScript is often refered to as a 'web app'. A good example of a web app is Gmail. If
        you view the source of a Gmail page you will see a lot of script tags and these indicate the usage of
        JavaScript. Click on this link to learn more: <a

          Web</a></li>
      <li>The example website that we will study: <a href="https://simplesite.joebloggsnz.repl.co/index.html">A simple
          website</a>. This site was built using the replit IDE (indegrated development environment). This environment
        is actually a good example of a web app. The image below shows a screenshot of it. The screen is split into
        three areas: the file system, the editor (showing the html of the home or index page at present), and a webview
        of the webpage when it is 'run' or served up.</li>
